# Call A Doctor

## Overview of Use/Purpose

**Call a Doctor (CaD)** is an application designed to facilitate convenient access to medical care by enabling patients to call doctors to their homes. With this application, patients can consult a doctor in the comfort of their homes, search for clinics, view registered clinics, and send requests for doctors to chosen clinics.

### Patient Features:
- **Search and View Clinics:** Easily find and view available clinics.
- **Make Appointment:** Send requests for doctors to specific clinics.

### Clinic Administrator Features:
- **Manage Requests:** Accept or reject patient requests.
- **Doctor Management:** Add or delete doctors from the clinic’s list.
- **Doctor Status:** View available and busy doctors.
- **Assign Doctors:** Assign available doctors to accepted patient requests.

### Doctor Features:
- **Patient Records:** View patient records.
- **Generate Prescriptions:** Create prescriptions for patients after each visit.

### Clinic Registration:
- Clinics must register to join the Call a Doctor project.
- Registration approval is handled by verifying with the Government Registered Doctor system to ensure official government registration.

The primary purpose of Call a Doctor is to streamline the process of accessing and providing medical care, making it more convenient for patients, administrators, and doctors alike.

## Description

The fast paced society has brought challenges to patients in terms of scheduling because of the issue of finding a suitable time to travel all the way to the clinic. The CaD application assists the society to resolve this issue by allowing patients to browse and book doctors from nearby clinics for home consultations. Therefore, patients can receive the medical care needed in the comforts and privacy of the users homes with just a few clicks away in a seamlessly integrated appointment system. 

Streamlining the process of booking and keeping track of medical appointments by developing a comprehensive window application with centralised nearby clinic and doctors information for the patient’s easy reference. Through a user-friendly interface, patients can easily browse and select a clinic with the preferred doctor to check for availability then proceed with making the appointment. On the other end, clinic administrators can easily manage the doctors availability and approve or deny the patients’ appointment requests to efficiently allocate medical resources.

Upon research on development methodologies as documented in 1.5, the agile methodology is utilised to complete the entire project. Various tools and techniques such as scrum meetings, github, figma and GUI packages were researched on and documented to understand the functionalities before leveraging the modern frameworks to efficiently develop, design and test the CaD window application in a short period of time. Each team member is to work closely with each other and have regular progress checks and consistent meetings to ensure the consistency and efficiency of this software development journey.

In this busy society and growing population, patients sometimes are faced with challenges when attempting to schedule and keep track of medical appointments. The process of attending for the appointment is troublesome because some patients may have mobility issues or overly busy schedules. Clinics are also faced with the struggles of attending to every patient who calls to make an appointment. This comes with the problem of patients having to wait on hold while the clinic admins are busy. The limitations of accessing current medical services are the long waiting times to make an appointment, inflexibility of the appointment time due to the space in the clinic and lack of centralised information on the medical services available within a vicinity. 

The target audience for this project are patients or the common public looking to make an appointment for medical consultation or services in the comforts of the user’s home, clinic admins who want to optimise operations and doctors looking to track appointments and easily review patients records.
